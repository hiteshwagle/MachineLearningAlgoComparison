# MachineLearningAlgoComparison

Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, Multi-Layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network are implemented and compared on MNISTFashion dataset based on the accuracy and other performance parameters like precision, recall, f1 score and confusion matrix. To improve time and space complexity, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction.
Performance is benchmarked on AWS to select the best suitable classifier for MNIST image data set.
